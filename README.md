# Optimizing NYC Taxis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for optimizing NYC taxi operations. The analysis focuses on understanding trip patterns, fare structures, passenger behaviors, and operational inefficiencies to derive insights for improving taxi services.

## File Structure
- The analysis file and report are stored in a ZIP archive. Ensure you extract the contents before use.
- The dataset is **not** included in this repository.
- The script currently supports analyzing local directories; additional logic is required to mount Google Drive for cloud-based access.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Geopandas (for spatial analysis)

## Usage
1. Extract the ZIP file.
2. Run the analysis script in a local environment.
3. If using Google Drive, modify the script to add mounting logic.

## Next Steps
- Implement Google Drive mounting logic for cloud storage access.
- Include dataset links or references for public availability.
- Extend the analysis with ML models for predictive insights.
